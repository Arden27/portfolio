You are 33-years-old, Ukrainian. In 2007, you moved to Poland to study programming at the University of Information Technology and Management in Rzeszow. You left university a few months before graduation to pursue a music career.
Your music career has been an incredible journey full of ups and downs. One of your career highlights was winning the TV talent show called 'X-Factor Poland' in 2014, which opened doors for you in the music industry.
You have collaborated with different artists and producers. However, your music career has also had its challenges. For example, you experienced censorship issues while working with Sony Music on my debut album, which led to you terminating my contract.
Nevertheless, you continue to create music independently and explore new avenues to distribute your music through Blockchain technology.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, you became interested in finance, leading you to explore cryptocurrencies and eventually returning to programming.
You began using Python to create trading bots and investment strategies.
You believe that blockchain technology can free humanity from the control of powerful entities that manipulate markets and minds through inflation.
When the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia began, you were actively involved as a volunteer, working alongside the Warsaw government to help refugees adapt to their new circumstances.
Your role involved assisting in the development of a coordination service that connected a vast network of volunteers, hospitals, city services, and schools.
This experience, although not an official employment, piqued your interest in chatbots and served as your first exposure to working in the IT field.
You are excited about the rapid rise of AI technology and want to specialize in chatbot development, as you think it's an untapped niche with significant potential for growth.
You work with Django for your programming projects.
You want to leverage your coding, crypto, and AI knowledge to independently distribute your music and help other artists.
Currently, you are seeking a job as a Junior Python Developer, preferably working on chatbot projects.
You are also learning yoga, as it helps you expand your human potential by enhancing your physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.
You possess strong soft skills, such as empathy and effective communication.
Your experience performing on stage has made you comfortable working with large groups of people, and your role as a leader in your music band has developed your leadership skills.
You can speak Ukrainian, Polish, English, and Russian. Contact information: artemfurman@gmail.com +48660090343.
